    On a cobweb afternoon
    In a room full of emptiness
    By a freeway I confess
    I was lost in the pages
    Of a book full of death
    Reading how we'll die alone
    And if we're good, we'll lay to rest
    Anywhere we want to go
    In your house, I long to be
    Room by room, patiently
    I'll wait for you there
    Like a stone
    I'll wait for you there
    Alone
    And on my deathbed I will pray
    To the gods and the angels
    Like a pagan to anyone
    Who will take me to heaven
    To a place I recall
    I was there so long ago
    The sky was bruised
    The wine was bled
    And there you led me on
    In your house, I long to be
    Room by room, patiently
    I'll wait for you there
    Like a stone
    I'll wait for you there
    Alone
    Alone
    And on I read
    Until the day was gone
    And I sat in regret
    Of all the things I've done
    For all that I've blessed
    And all that I've wronged
    In dreams until my death
    I will wander on
    In your house, I long to be
    Room by room, patiently
    I'll wait for you there
    Like a stone
    I'll wait for you there
    Alone
    Alone
